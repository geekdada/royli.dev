croc is a tool that allows any two computers to simply and securely transfer files and folders. AFAIK, croc is the only CLI file-transfer tool that does all of the following:


- allows any two computers to transfer data (using a relay)

- provides end-to-end encryption (using PAKE)

- enables easy cross-platform transfers (Windows, Linux, Mac)

- allows multiple file transfers

- allows resuming transfers that are interrupted

- local server or port-forwarding not needed

- ipv6-first with ipv4 fallback

- can use proxy, like tor
